# 🧠 Sentiment Analyzer

A modular Python project for sentiment analysis on user reviews using traditional ML and optional integration with deep learning.

## 📦 Features

- 🔁 Modular code architecture with reusable components
- 🧹 Text preprocessing with NLTK (cleaning, lemmatization, stopword removal)
- 🧠 Multiple model support (Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)
- 🎯 Evaluation with classification report and confusion matrix
- 🧪 Unit testing using `unittest` framework
- 🚀 Interactive API using Flask for real-time inference
- 💾 Model persistence using joblib
- 📊 Visualization using seaborn and matplotlib
- 🧪 Jupyter Notebook for end-to-end demo and reporting
- 🌟 Optional: Integration with pretrained transformers like BERT for advanced performance
- 🌐 Streamlit UI for simple front-end interaction

## 🚀 How to Run
